### Contest Judges - Mappers

Unlike the last iteration, this year's contest is planned to host an accumulative leaderboard, enabling all participants to stay in the contest for as long as it goes. To determine the placements, we will need the help of the mappers extraordinaire, modding enthusiasts, and maybe even you (yes, you!) to partake as judges throughout the contest.

Now, you may have questions regarding which criteria these judges will rate the submissions. Worry not! Here are the criteria:

- **Cohesion**: This criterion will focus on how consistent the map is. All elements of the map has to remain coherent with the rhythm and the music. For instance, if the entry represents the music well and the sections from different members are integrated seamlessly without weird transitions and abrupt spikes, that entry deserves to be praised.
- **Expertise**: Our judges are also expected to focus on the advanced skills or expertise of mapping. A map with high expertise shows excellent management over note patterns, flows, movements, and even hitsounds. Those maps are outstanding compared with their peers in this contest and mark themselves as top-tier in the state-of-the-art mapping community.
- **Creativity**: As with everything, beatmaps and mapping techniques are subject to change over time. Moreover, the history of osu!mapping is always shaped by creative maps, showing an avant-garde or even ahead-of-time understanding of mapping. Creative yet solid maps are the art of osu! and thus definitely promoted in this contest.

On top of these, we will also entertain another section named **Judge's Impression**, which is left to the judges' sole discretion. Judges can use this for extra scores or penalties for their specific comments or remarks on something in the entry.

We are planning to allocate **7 judges** per round in order to establish a fairer competition. Additionally, these judges will not remain the same throughout the contest and will be rotated every round. In other words, we will be looking for **14 judges in total** that will deliver their judgments regarding the submissions from round to round.

### Contest Judges - Players

Attention to all professional osu! players! A brand new section called **Players' Pick** is making its appearance for the osu! Beatmapping World Championship.

Players' Pick is a new side-competition that will be organized in parallel to the primary contest. Aside from the conventional contest winners, we will consult a handful of professional circle clickers on evaluating each submission as of the second round of the contest, eventually determining a winning team that will receive the Players' Pick award!

"How?" you say? Well, obviously, our circle-clicking specialists will be evaluating these submissions under a set of criteria, which are listed below:

- **Sophistication**: This criterion will focus on how comfortable it is to play the beatmap, according to its difficulty level. As much as they can be considered pieces of art, beatmaps are defined as in-game levels made for users to enjoy them. Therefore, for them to gain players' attraction, they need to be player-friendly first.
- **Profundity**: Players are supposed to rate the quality of the beatmap by looking at nothing but its structure. Playing a super-simple jump/stream map might be fun, but we are here to have a competition here after all! Establishing complex mapping structures can take vast amounts of time and effort. Thus players are supposed to take the profundities of the beatmaps into account during their evaluation.
- **Uniqueness**: Throughout the history of osu!, we can see that beatmaps displaying unique patterns usually be the centre of community attention and sometimes even become era-defining masterpieces. With that in mind, we would like to draw players' attention to the artistic aspects of mapping and see where their opinions revolve.

Additionally, we will also entertain a **Player's Impression** section. Players are asked to note down their personal thoughts and subjective opinions regarding the beatmap and rate it accordingly.

To take part as a Players' Pick judge, your osu! rank needs to be *higher than #5000* as the initial requirement. We're planning to recruit **5 judges** in total for this section of the contest. So if you're a professional osu! player and like playing a variety of beatmaps, don't miss out on becoming a Players' Pick judge!

### Multi-mode Judges

Drummers, fruit catchers, and keyboard smashers behold! This year, we are going to host three more contests for three other game modes. The details are still worked on, but if you're an early bird wishing to partake as a judge for the osu!taiko, osu!catch, or osu!mania edition of the osu! Beatmapping World Championship, you may submit your application right away!
