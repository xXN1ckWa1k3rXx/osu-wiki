Delivering a new experience around every corner, **technoplanet** is the monster of a composer behind high energy electronic tunes, orchestral instrumentation, classic band sounds, and just about every style in between. Their music has been showcased in countless rhythm games already, and as of today, osu! is officially included in that lineup!

Explore the otherworldly beatmapping possibilities of the **12** songs available from [**technoplanet**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/193)!
