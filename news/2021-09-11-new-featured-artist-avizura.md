We're thrilled to announce **Avizura** aboard as our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/198/header.jpg)

Setting sail from the *Newgrounds* music scene more than 10 years ago and docking in the osu! scene today, **Avizura** is a multi-faceted drum & bass producer, visual artist, and indie game developer hailing from the Netherlands. Their tunes harken back to the golden age of drum & bass on osu!, highlighted by an ultra popular beatmap of [*Lucky Star*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/130546) created by [Bearizm](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3495259)!

We've picked up **8** celestial tracks, all available for mapping from [**Avizura**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/198)! Each track also comes paired with a ~2:00 cut version designed specifically for mappers who have the attention span of a chicken nugget.

Need a refresher on **Avizura**'s sound? Experience the duality of osu!'s leaderboard toppers with the video featuring the familiar tune *Lucky Star*, or browse through the rest of the previews:

[**Avizura**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/198) is right around the corner. You'll find it between the antique shop and the abandoned gas station. Only local mappers know about it, so head over there before it becomes an overcrowded tourist spot.

This week may be done, but we'll be back next week with the strength of an osu! player's flexor digitorum profundus! That's the muscle responsible for flexing your tapping fingers, so it's strong. Probably. Stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) to learn less about physiology and more about upcoming artists!
