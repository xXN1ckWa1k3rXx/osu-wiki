**Lundy** hops aboard the Featured Artist train!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/203/header.jpg)

A growing name in the rhythm-game scene with the chops of a veteran, producer **Lundy** is responsible for inventing his own orchestral twist on electronic music.

Catering directly to osu! player attention spans, **11** eccentric tracks averaging 2 minutes in length are steamy and ready for pickup from [**Lundy**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/203).

Start digging into these treats with a video of [*Lundy - STOP?*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1584108) showcasing the behind the scenes mechanics of osu!taiko's slider velocity. Once you're done with that, the rest of the previews will be waiting for you!
