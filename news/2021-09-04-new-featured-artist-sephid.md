"Smashes" may be a bit of an understatement given the skull-shattering intensity found in each of these songs. Pulling inspiration from creators like [*Camellia*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31), [*BlackY*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/150), *DJ YOSHITAKA*, and *xi*, **SEPHID** has mastered his own fierce sound that's ready to be officially shared with the osu! community.

**19** songs are ready to be paired with your mapping prowess from [**SEPHID**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/196)!

If you managed to survive this long without visiting [**SEPHID**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/196), you might have a serious problem. Please talk to your doctor or visit **SEPHID**'s page as soon as possible — whichever is most convenient.

Unrelated, but you may have noticed a new "Featured Artist" badge on certain beatmaps! Recognition, huzzah!

A bunch of beatmaps using Featured Artist tracks are still missing the badge, but these will be automatically accounted for in the coming days.

And that's all for now! As you're surely aware, the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) is the place to be if you're looking for the newest info on our upcoming artists (and tons of other osu! stuff), so keep an eye out and we'll see you soon!
