**Release Hallucination** is unleashed as our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/194/header.jpg)

Shining the spotlight on osu!'s gothic rock sound, **Release Hallucination** is a progressive metal band with a dark symphonic twist. Comprised of singer/lyricist *Emi* and composer/producer/guitarist *Kaoru*, the duo is evolving their genre with smoothly intertwined ideas from unexpected realms like jazz and modern classical music.

We've picked up **20** tracks from their discography stretching back to 2012, all of which are craving to be mapped from [**Release Hallucination**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/194).

**Release Hallucination**'s song *Chronostasis* is likely a familiar track to players across all modes. If you're somehow not part of the cool-osu!-players-club though, feel free to experience the song through 3 of its beatmaps in the video below, then check out the rest of these powerful previews:
