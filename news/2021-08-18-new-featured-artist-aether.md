**Aether** traverses the fog and lands in our Featured Artist roster!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/191/header.jpg)

Setting sails in 2013 under the alias **Aether**, Jason Taylor is a Canadian musician who's known for a mix of relaxing classical sounds and modern electronic concepts, all packed with a stylistic leaning towards games.

**Aether** is known for composing scores for games like *Kingdoms & Castles* and *Röki* as well as releases involving collaboration between talented musicians worldwide. Oh, and now he's also known for being one of osu!'s Featured Artists!

We've snagged **14** tracks for [**Aether**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/191), ranging from piano pieces to electronic hits to chill beats featuring talented vocalist *Veela*.

Curious how osu! and **Aether** came to meet? Take a peek at [Asphyxia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1715720)'s pattern-centric mapping through this video of [Aether & Sizzlebird - Raccoon City (feat. Veela)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/725387), then listen to the rest of the previews below once you're hooked.

The rest of the songs in this batch can be found on [**Aether**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/191), all pre-timed for your upcoming mapping magnum opus.

Believe it or not, we recently passed a milestone of **4000 total featured artist tracks**! We're actually closer to 4250 at this point, but we hadn't actually checked until today. Regardless, it's pretty insane to think about since we only surpassed 3000 total tracks at the end of last year!

And the journey still isn't over! Our Featured Artist collection continues growing and growing, so watch the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) to keep up with all the news and whatnot.

See you Saturday!
