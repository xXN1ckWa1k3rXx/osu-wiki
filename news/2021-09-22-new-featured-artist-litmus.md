Put your mapping skills to the test with our newest Featured Artist **litmus\***!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/201/header.jpg)

Modern legend in the rhythm-game scene **litmus\*** (a.k.a. **Ester**) is a long-time *BMS OF FIGHTERS* participant who spends his time contrasting upbeat EDM and classic rhythm-game styles while drinking his endless supply of Pepsi. This isn't a sponsor. He's addicted to Pepsi.

Recognizable by anyone familiar with games like *CHUNITHM CRYSTAL*, *Cytus II*, *Lanota*, and *VOEZ*, **litmus\*** is quickly rising as a top tier contributor to the music game universe. As of today, osu! is ready to join that list.

We've chiseled out **21** songs from **litmus\***'s back-catalogue for your mapping pleasure, all up for grabs from [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/201)!

**litmus\*** is best known on osu! for rhythm-game-focused songs under their **Ester** alias like [*Krave*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1551054). Witness the inevitable struggle of 5-digit and 6-digit cooperation through this video, then explore the rest of the previews to get the full picture of **litmus\***'s work:

Test the waters for yourself by mapping with any of the pre-timed beatmaps on [**litmus\***'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/201). For the sake of the artist, we'd also like to make a formal apology for this pun. Look out for the TwitLonger soon.

Speaking of nonsense tweets, you'd be crazy if you didn't keep watch over the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for the juice on our next Featured Artist. It'll be a good one (as always, of course). See you on Saturday!
