Treat yourself to the latest addition to our Featured Artist catalogue: **rejection**!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/199/header.jpg)

Exemplifying the core of doujin rhythm game music, **rejection** is a DJ/producer whose songs span from instrumental masterpieces to vocal works featuring notable singers in the doujin scene like *Such*, [*Aitsuki Nakuru*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/127), and *mami*. No matter what you're looking for, **rejection** has you covered.

**14** songs are up for grabs from [**rejection**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/199), most of which come with a game-size two-minute version supplied by the artist specifically for osu!. Thanks for being cool, **rejection**.

We're sure you've heard **rejection**'s music already, but since you're clearly yearning for more, experience the hype behind *rejection - Signal feat. Such* through this video of an ultra-wide beatmap, then explore the other previews below:

Trickle on over to [**rejection**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/199) for the rest of the awesome songs that are up for grabs. Only go there if you *really* want to though. We doubt osu!'s servers can handle everyone downloading these conveniently pre-timed beatmap templates simultaneously, but feel free to prove us wrong.

Saturday will mark the coming of our 200th Featured Artist! Woo! While this is a huuuuuge milestone, we honestly don't have anything special planned, so keep your expectations at the usual "extremely-high-because-every-Featured-Artist-is-awesome."

We'll see you this weekend!
