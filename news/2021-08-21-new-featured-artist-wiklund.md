Retro composer **Wiklund** climbs on board as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/192/header.jpg)

What began as a kid in his bedroom messing with dusty gameboy sounds has transformed into Swedish producer **Wiklund**'s old-school chiptune music. Taking inspiration from the "demoscene" and 80's synthpop, his songs harken back to a simpler time of distance snap and grid-based mapping. Oh, and 8-bit video games, I guess.

We've snagged **10** classics for mappers to dive into, including everything from **Wiklund**'s nostalgic album *Wing Beats* — a favourite of mappers from the olden days, and [one of osu!'s first album-focused beatmap projects](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/17053). Check it all out from [**Wiklund**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/192)!

Experience some of **Wiklund**'s music for yourself with this 2009 map of [*Billy Boogie*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/9040) as seen through the display that 100% of osu! players were using a decade ago. Once you're done with that, maybe explore the rest of these previews too:

Surprising absolutely nobody, even more of **Wiklund**'s music can be found on [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/192)! Will you be the first person to make a dissonant slider-heavy tech map over retro chiptune music? Nobody's asking for it, but we'll wish you luck anyway.

That's all for this week! Next week we'll be jumping back with a couple Japanese artists with polar opposite genres to showcase. Stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for updates on that and we'll see you soon!
