This song has penetrated every corner of the osu! community, with ranked beatmaps spanning all game modes and totaling nearly 8 million plays across the board.

Unlike our usual artist announcements, there's only 1 song available on [**Our Stolen Theory**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/200). The band hasn't actively produced music in a long time, but their track *United (L.A.O.S Remix)* has made an undeniable impact on the osu! community, and we're beyond happy to carve out a special place for it in the osu! community.

[**Our Stolen Theory**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/200) is osu!'s 200th Featured Artist. That's a big deal.

It's honestly hard to believe how quickly things have blown up around here. We reached [**100 artists**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-09-23-new-featured-artist-epica) less than a year ago, and it took **4 years** since the start of the Featured Artist program to reach that milestone.

Raw numbers might help put the current size of osu!'s Featured Artist library into perspective:

- **4,326 tracks from 200 artists** are available for mapping from our Featured Artists!
- **2,320 beatmaps have been ranked** using Featured Artist songs! Another **1,758 beatmaps** are currently pending or works in progress.
- Beatmaps using Featured Artist songs have been **favourited over 720,000 times!**
- Players have accumulated over **1.37 billion plays** throughout all maps using songs from our Featured Artists!
- osu! players have spent roughly **1,933 years (yes, YEARS) playing maps of Featured Artist songs!** We're assuming non-pass plays are 10% of the map's length, so there's a lot of room for error on this stat. It's still an insane amount of time though.

While big numbers are cool, they don't reeeeally showcase one of our biggest goals with the Featured Artist program.

osu!'s 14 years of community-designed content is full of artists and songs that have strong connections to the osu! scene like [***Our Stolen Theory** - United (L.A.O.S Remix)*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=artist%3D%22our%20stolen%20theory%22%20united). We want to ensure that these community icons are properly supported for use in osu! until the end of the universe, so we'll be continuing with that aim while picking up our next hundred Featured Artists.

That said, thanks for guiding us on the never-ending Featured Artist train.

See you next time!
