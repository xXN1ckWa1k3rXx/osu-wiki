In case you're new around here, [**Kuba Oms - My Love**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/163112) is that "memorable beatmap". Participants of the [A Labour of Love](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest) contest created a full beatmap experience around *My Love*, including each of these elements:

- Remix of **Kuba Oms - My Love**
- Beatmap spread of the remix
- Storyboard or custom video

After 5 months of hard work from creators and judges along with votes from thousands of osu! players, we're stoked to recap the outcome of osu!'s most ambitious contest yet!

## Judge results

Alongside the community vote, we asked a curated group of 18 experienced mappers and musicians to give their input on the entries as well! See the panelists from [A Labour of Love's wiki page](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest#prizes).

Following a format similar to [Monthly Beatmapping Contest screening](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening), each of the judges selected their ordered top 5 entries focusing on their area of expertise (mapping or music production). Each position in a judge's top 5 was assigned a number (first place = 5 points, second place = 4 points, etc.), and the sum of these selections made up the mapping and musician panel results.

The overall panel followed the same format with contribution from all judges. Their top 5 picks were based on an evaluation of the full beatmap package (song remix, beatmap, visuals, and general cohesiveness of the elements). To balance out the 6 musician-focused panelists with the 12 mapping-focused panelists, musicians were given more weight in the overall category.

A full overview of judge results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTts0zpdjKdCUS3oCP4XZ18vh5ckEDqL_Jvy2eh0B4kC8je09bCGwYcpOWgjaXXy0251c3f33u7BDjv/pubhtml) and on the [A Labour of Love wiki page](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest#prizes)

### Overall runner-up

Team *schoolboy fans* takes the contest's theme of celebrating a classic beatmap to its limit with their submission [**Kuba Oms - My Love (Shadren Remix)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1382412)!

![Overall runner-up badge](/wiki/shared/news/2021-04-27-results-a-labour-of-love/runnerup.png)

Nostalgia is the name of the game with this entry. Sporting a retro synthwave remix by [Shadren](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/745494), a simply classic beatmap spread of Easy through Insane by [Shmiklak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5504231) / [Shadren](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/745494) / [Daycore](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5596337) / [wajinshu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6339790), and an absolute masterpiece of a storyboard by Shmiklak, this submission brings you back to your cherished osu! memories from years past.

While it may not have scored especially high from either the mapper or musician panels alone, factoring in the storyboard is what pushed this entry above the crowd. For creating their overall solid submission, everyone on team *schoolboy fans* received the overall runner-up profile badge!

![Overall runner-up badge](/wiki/shared/news/2021-04-27-results-a-labour-of-love/alol_overallrunnerup@2x.png)

Seeing as the *Elite Storyboarder* title wasn't awarded to anyone in the overall winning team, we've passed down the title to [Shmiklak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5504231) for their outstanding creativity in this contest (along with their vast experience with storyboarding elsewhere of course!).

### Overall winner

Taking the breath away from mappers and musicians across the board, team *extremely valid* wears the heart-shaped crown with their submission [**Raphlesia & BilliumMoto - My Love**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1388906#osu/2868388)!

![Overall runner-up badge](/wiki/shared/news/2021-04-27-results-a-labour-of-love/overall.jpeg)

Yep, that's right. This entry received #1 in the musician-focused panel, the mapping panel, and the overall panel. With just a few more votes they could've even taken the community vote — insane, right?

This remix by [Shinwoir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8984574) (a.k.a. Raphlesia) and [BilliumMoto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3862471) is practically perfect for a rhythm game setting, and who would've expected less from a combo involving the last [osu! remix contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/1) winner? [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515) / [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334) / [Realazy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/918297) took full advantage of this perfect track too, crafting a 6-difficulty spread that appeals to players on every level with stellar performances from everyone involved. While this entry's storyboard was a bit lackluster compared to the other entries, this one clearly focused on the other aspects and managed to make it work anyway.

Given their landslide of a win on the judging side of things, it's more than fitting to reward everyone on team *extremely valid* with the overall winner profile badge!

## Conclusion

Congratulations again to all the winners and thanks to everyone who participated in A Labour of Love!

We hope this contest has been as fun for you as it has been for us. Community members joining together to produce something cool has been the spirit of osu! since the very beginning, and it's awesome to see that feeling shine through in every submission (...except maybe [this one](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1348553), sorry team *Down*).

This may be the end for A Labour of Love, but there's no doubt that another contest focused on the full beatmap experience will fill its shoes one day. It's rare for a contest to connect with so many different people throughout the osu! world like this one has, and we look forward to fully embracing that again at some point in the future.

See you next time.
