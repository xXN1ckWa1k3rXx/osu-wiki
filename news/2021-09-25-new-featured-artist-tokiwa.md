**tokiwa** steals the spotlight as our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/202/header.jpg)

From playing rhythm games to composing music for them, **tokiwa** is a Japanese producer and lyricist with an ever-growing collection of future bass and other electronic spinoff songs. Drawing their first musical inspiration from sources like *beatmania IIDX*, **tokiwa** has mastered their own pop/indie/club-infused style catering directly to the music game sector.

[**tokiwa**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/202) has **8** tracks for you to sink your teeth into. New mappers are permitted to gum the tracks too.

[Mocaotic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9487458) of the Mappers' Guild is here to kick things off with their beatmap of [*wasurena feat. Sennzai*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1496234). Experience how **tokiwa**'s music translates to mapping through the minimalist osu! experience below, then sift through the rest of the maps/previews:
