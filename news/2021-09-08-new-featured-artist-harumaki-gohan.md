**Harumaki Gohan** takes center stage as the latest addition to the Featured Artist lineup!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/197/header.jpg)

You haven't seen a jack of all trades until you've taken notice of **Harumaki Gohan**. While he's primarily known as an exceptional VOCALOID composer/producer, he's also illustrated and animated his own music videos, and recently began singing covers of his own VOCALOID works.

Each of the **16** tracks available from [**Harumaki Gohan**'s Featured Artist page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/197) hit hard with undeniably pure emotion, including 11 VOCALOID tracks and 5 covers sung by the rice spring roll himself.

Taking a page out of **Harumaki Gohan**'s notebook, we took osu! to the beach for a perfect view of the sky described in [*Harumaki Gohan - Suisei ni Nareta nara*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1344515). Take a peek at that and the other song previews below:
