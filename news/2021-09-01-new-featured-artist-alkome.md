We're proud to welcome **Alkome** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/195/header.jpg)

Releasing music since 2018 with the expertise of a veteran, **Alkome** is a Japanese producer you might recognize from [*Alkome - Mind Disorder*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1301375) in the [OWC 2020](/wiki/en/Tournaments/OWC/2020) semifinals map pool. Known for his mesh of concepts from the UK Hardcore genre and other styles across the spectrum, **Alkome**'s modern approach to music has already been adopted by rhythm games like *SOUND VOLTEX* and *SEVEN's CODE*.

Push yourself with any of the **11** tracks we have on deck, all available from [**Alkome**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/195) for your mapping convenience.

For those who may have missed last year's world cup, flip through the map that brought **Alkome** to osu! through the video below, then diversify with the rest of the previews:
