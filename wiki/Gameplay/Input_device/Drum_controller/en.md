# Drum controller

![](img/taiko-drum.jpg "Taiko drum")

**Drum controllers** are input devices designed to work with Taiko-like drum games. They most often have four areas of input: right drum center, left drum center, right drum rim, and left drum rim, with each input (key) being activated with a drum stick that is smacked down on the corresponding area of the drum.

## Input

Owners of Taiko drum controllers for the [PlayStation 4 (PS4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4) or the [Nintendo Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch) will need to plug their controllers into the computer via USB and bind the correct keys in the osu! settings. Owners of the [Wii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii) Tatacon controller will need to pair their controller to their computer before enabling the Wiimote/Tatacon support option in the osu! settings. Most third party drum controllers will also work with osu!, but support may vary.
