# Wiimote

![](img/wiimote.jpg "Wiimote")

**Wiimote** is the primary game controller for Nintendo [Wii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii). Although  mostly seen as gimmicky or silly, the Wiimote can be used in osu! to aim using the sensor bar. You can rebind any button to click in the osu! options.

The Wiimote may also be used to control [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko) drum hits via motion controls or buttons on the Wiimote itself. However, this may require some more advanced knowledge of software and Wiimotes in order to get it working.
