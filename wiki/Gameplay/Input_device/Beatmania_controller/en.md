![](img/beatmania-controller.jpg "7-button Beatmania controller")

A **Beatmania controller** is a type of game controllers that is compatible with the *[Beatmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatmania)* game series.

Due to their nature, Beatmania controllers are most often used as input devices in [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania).

## Input methods

Players, who have a Playstation 2 (PS2) *Beatmania* controller, can use an adapter to connect the controller to their computer via USB and bind the keys in the options. However, players, who have a *DJ DAO IIDX* controller, can simply plug in the controller to their computer via USB and bind the keys.
