# Slider break

**Slider break** (sometimes abbreviated as *SB*) is a term used to describe the act of breaking one's combo via a partially-completed [slider](/wiki/Hit_object/Slider). Slider breaks can occur in three different ways: missing the head of a slider whilst still completing or partially-completing the body, letting go of a slider at any point of its duration, or not collecting all of the slider ticks. All three "ways" are collectively called a "slider break" and will break the player's combo. Receiving a slider break during a play will result in a `100` being received and will break the combo, but will not count as a miss.

*Note: A play that has no misses, but contains one or more slider breaks will result in an S grade (or Silver S) being received, assuming that all [Accuracy](/wiki/Gameplay/Accuracy) requirements have been met to receive in an S grade.*
