# Tablet cover

<!--See also: [Tablet](link)-->

A **tablet cover** is a sheet of protective material special that encases or sticks onto the surface of a graphics tablet for additional protection. Said covers are similar to smartphone [screen protectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_protector), with the only significant differences being shape and design. And although tablet covers ultimately serve the same purpose of most other device screen protectors, tablet covers are often specifically designed to reduce nibwear, prolong the lifespan of said tablet, and protect the surface of the tablet from scratches. Some tablet covers—namely ones designed specifically for osu!—can also create a surface that is more glossy, smooth, or rough, depending on the type and preferences of the user.

Tablet covers often come in a form that is almost identical to smartphone screen protectors, except for the fact that the side that sticks only uses a strip of sticky material along the outer edges of the protective material. This is to avoid damage with the actual tablet surface's material, and allows for the use of pressure sensitivity and other features for digital drawing.

## DIY vs. manufactured

Many forum posts that ask about where to buy or make tablet covers often mention how easy it is to create one. Common DIY tablet covers use a variety of materials that can be found at home or in-store for relatively cheap. Whereas manufactured tablet covers often use specialized materials to reduce nibwear and last longer.
