# Nuke

**Nukes** were a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) moderation tool in the early years of osu!. Any beatmaps that were considered to be disregarding the rules (or the creator disregarding the [Code of Conduct](/wiki/Rules/Code_of_Conduct_for_Modding_and_Mapping)) could be nuked by either the [Beatmap Appreciation Team (BAT)](/wiki/Modding/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team) or the [Global Moderation Team (GMT)](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team).

When a beatmap was nuked, it would have a radioactive symbol ![](/wiki/shared/icon/nuke.gif) on its beatmap thread. This would signal other members of the BAT/GMT that it was not to be considered for [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure#ranked) until significant changes had been made. If a beatmap made the corresponding changes, the icon would be removed and it could proceed with the [ranking process](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure).

Beatmaps could be nuked for a multitude of reasons, but the most common ones were:

- Not following the basics of the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).
  - Containing mistimed sections
  - Containing randomly placed [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) on the grid and/or timeline
  - Extremely challenging or unconventional beatmaps (e.g. consisting of a single [spinner](/wiki/Hit_object/Spinner)).
- Not following the [Code of Conduct](/wiki/Rules/Code_of_Conduct_for_Modding_and_Mapping).

Nukes technically still exist on the forums, but with the addition of [Modding v2](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion) and [vetoes](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Veto) they have effectively been replaced and have no use in the current modding system.
