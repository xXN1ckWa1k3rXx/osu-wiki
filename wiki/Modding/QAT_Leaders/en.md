# QAT Leaders

Following [Loctav](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/71366)'s leave from osu! management at the end of 2017, the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/Modding/Quality_Assurance_Team) (*QAT*) elected **QAT leaders** to take control of the group. This decision was made because members of the QAT felt that Loctav and [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) had too much control of the group, and that the QAT would be better led by its own members.

The vote for QAT leaders was handled through a vote of all [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators) and QAT members. Results of the vote, found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/640679), promoted [Okoratu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405) and [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508) as the first QAT leaders. Their responsibility was to work with the osu! team to maintain the mapping and modding communities.

The QAT leaders were replaced with [-Mo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2202163), [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515), and [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) throughout the next two years.

By 2020, there was no need for a formal QAT (eventually [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team) (*NAT*)) leader position. The group is self-moderated currently.
