# Beatmap description

**Beatmap description** is a small area under a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap)'s page that gives players information about the beatmap using [BBCode](/wiki/BBCode). It usually highlights some facts about the beatmap its creator deemed important enough, or is used to advertise other mapping projects.

## Uses and information

Popular descriptions of [ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) beatmaps often include the following:

- A list of all the [guest difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Guest_difficulty) and their creators
- Information that would help a player decide whether they want to download the beatmap or not
- A list of edits, or changelog

### Images

Many beatmap descriptions contain at least one image (often an animated [GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) of some sort) which is used to express and illustrate either the creator, song, and/or beatmap in a flashy way. They can also serve as a title or header to add flair and quality. To learn how to add an image, check out the [BBCode article's section on images](/wiki/BBCode#image).

### Difficulty sections

A *difficulty section* is a list of all guest difficulties (often alongside with the respective icons) and their creators located in a beatmap description. It is mostly used to credit the guest mappers.

The difficulty icons can be found in the [Difficulty](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty) article.
