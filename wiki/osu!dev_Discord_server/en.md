# osu!dev Discord server

**osu!dev** is the official [Discord](https://discordapp.com) server for working on osu!'s open source and community projects. This is the main place to contribute to osu!'s development and get in touch with the [osu! team](/wiki/People/The_Team).

The permanent invite link is <https://discord.gg/ppy>.

## Verification

New members of the server aren't allowed to send messages by default. If they want to send messages, they can post in `#arrival` with a brief overview of their intentions, and a member of the osu! team will add a role that lifts the restriction.

## Projects
