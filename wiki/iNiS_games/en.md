# iNiS games

*See also: [osu! (disambiguation)](/wiki/Disambiguation/osu!)*

The [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode) and osu! itself were originally based on rhythm games developed by **[iNiS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INiS_Corporation)** for the [Nintendo DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS) in the early 2000s. ![][flag_AU] [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) built osu! to be a simulator and level editor for the iNiS games, and the earliest community members were generally fans of them too. Older [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) were heavily influenced by iNiS level design.

The games referred to are:

- [Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan) (*Ouendan*)
- [Elite Beat Agents](#elite-beat-agents) (*EBA*)
- [Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan! 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moero!_Nekketsu_Rhythm_Damashii_Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan_2) (*Ouendan 2*)

## Elite Beat Agents

<!--TODO: Insert lots of links and sections for Ouendan games, talk about which game mechanics are old and new -->
