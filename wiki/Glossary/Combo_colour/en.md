# Combo colour

*For combo colours beatmapping rules, see: [Ranking criteria/osu!](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/osu!) and [Ranking criteria/osu!catch](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/osu!catch)*

**Combo colours** are colours which help separate [combosets](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) from another. Combo colurs apply to all [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) in a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap). When a new combo is started, the colour of [combos](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) changes to the next defined colour. The `New Combo` button can be found on the right side of the `Compose` tab in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor).

Combo colouring is an important aspect to a beatmap's aesthetics, as it is one of the only ways to change the visuals of a beatmap besides [storyboarding](/wiki/Storyboard/Scripting) and [skinning](/wiki/Skinning). Combo colours can be set in the [Song Setup](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Song_Setup) panel with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 combo colours. Combo colours defined in a skin will only be used when a mapper does not define any combo colours, or when the player overrides it in their settings.

## osu!

In [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!), all [combosets](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) have a colour. A new combo is started when the colour of the [hit object](/wiki/Hit_object) changes. The colours will keep repeating themselves depending on how many the mapper defined (or how many your skin's [skin.ini](/wiki/Skinning/skin.ini) file defines).

## osu!catch

In [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch), each fruit is coloured in the order given. Droplets and end-slider fruit will always have the same colour as the start-fruit. However, bananas will always have a tint of yellow.
