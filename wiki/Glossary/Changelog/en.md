# Changelog

<!-- for the purpose of learning the history through the Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org/), the changelog is available at different URLs:

The **[changelog](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog)** is a page where the [osu! development team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Developers) details their day-by-day improvements, additions, and bug fixes to the game. All changes from prior releases are recorded here for archiving purposes.

The changelogs for the website and osu!(lazer) are generated automatically based on GitHub releases of those projects, while the rest are maintained manually.

On October 28, 2015, a graph with osu! versions distribution across the playerbase [was added to the changelog](https://web.archive.org/web/20151103161516/http://osu.ppy.sh:80/p/changelog), making the statistics open to the general public. At the same time, it became possible to filter the changelog by update stream.
