# Geki

*See also: [Katu](/wiki/Katu)*

**Geki (æ¿€)**, or *Elite Beat!*, is a [scoring](/wiki/Score) term for when a [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) is completed with the highest possible [accuracy](/wiki/Gameplay/Accuracy) on every note. It gives higher HP boost in comparison with the last 300 on a non-perfect combo.

Geki comes from the Nintendo DS game [Elite Beat Agents](/wiki/iNiS_games), which [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!)'s gameplay is based on.

## Other game modes

### osu!taiko

Geki is only shown on the results screen for successful large note hits.

### osu!catch

osu!catch doesn't have Geki.

### osu!mania

Geki denotes a perfectly timed hit, and its osu!mania sprite is a rainbow-coloured `300`, often called MAX. Its score value is 320, but it has the same accuracy value as a regular 300.

## Storyboard

### DS Games

Geki triggers the best tier on the storyboard during the gameplay, which usually shows very strong spirit during the sequence.

### osu!

Obtaining Geki triggers several events:

- [Fail Layer](/wiki/Storyboard/Scripting/General_Rules#layers) is deactivated.
- [Pass Layer](/wiki/Storyboard/Scripting/General_Rules#layers) is activated.
- "Passing" event is triggered, if the previous state was "Fail".
