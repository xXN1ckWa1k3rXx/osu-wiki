By not signing in, the game client will mark you as a "Guest" and you will not be able to fetch online scores, submit scores, or play [Multi](/wiki/Multi).

You can access this menu by clicking on your player card where available.

### Language

| Name | Description | Type | Default |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `Select language` | Display a list of languages to select. | Dropdown |  |
| `Prefer metadata in original language` | In the song select screen, beatmaps will display their original or untranslated metadata, if available. | Checkbox | `Disabled` |
| `Use alternative font for chat display` | Uses the old font (Tahoma) instead of the current font (Aller) in the [chat console](/wiki/chat_console). | Checkbox | `Disabled` |

### Updates

| Name | Description | Type | Default |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `Release stream` | Display a list of builds that you want to use. | Dropdown | `Stable` |
| `Your osu! is up-to-date!` | Click to force the game client to check for updates again and download them, if any. | Button |  |
| `Open osu! folder` | Open the local osu! folder, which contains your skins, beatmaps, etc. | Button |  |

---

If you open the dropdown list for `Release stream`, you will be presented with these options:

| Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `Stable` | Stable public release build. |
| `Beta` | Dev build - gets new features early, but possibly buggier. |
| `Cutting Edge (Experimental)` | Dev build - gets new features even earlier, but possibly significantly buggier. |

## Graphics

![Graphics icon](img/graphics.jpg "Graphics icon")

This section is about the appearance of your game client, parts of the interface and video settings.

### Renderer

| Name | Description | Type | Default |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `Frame limiter` | Set the frame rate limit. See below for details. | Dropdown | `Optimal` |
| `Show FPS counter` | Toggle the FPS counter. This is seen in the bottom-right corner of the screen. | Checkbox | `Disabled` |
| `Compatibility mode` | Use the old renderer that osu! used before with older computers. This will restart your game client. | Checkbox | `Disabled` |
| `Reduce dropped frames` | Adjust graphical settings to decrease dropped/stuttered frames. | Checkbox | `Disabled` |
| `Detect performance issues` | Warn you if another program on your computer may harm your client's performance. | Checkbox | `Enabled` |

---

*Note: When the game client is not the active window, the fps limit is dropped to 30fps automatically.*

*Caution to laptop users: using `Unlimited (gameplay)` may cause your laptop to overheat!*

If you open the dropdown list for `Frame Limiter`, you will be presented with these options:

| Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `VSync` | Limits the game client to the refresh rate of your monitor. See explanation below for details. |
| `Power Saving` | Limits the game client to twice the refresh rate of your monitor. |
| `Optimal` | Limits the game client to eight times the refresh rate of your monitor, capping at 960fps. |
| `Unlimited (gameplay)` | Limits the game client to the refresh rate of your monitor. See explanation below for details. |

- `VSync` explanation: In layman terms, using VSync will force the game wait for the entire frame to load before displaying it.
  - You may want to use this if you see some "tearing" (when the bottom portion of the game is lagging behind the upper portion of the game).
  - Despite what the point above stated, this may cause some lag or slowdowns because the game client has to wait for each frame to load.
- `Unlimited (gameplay)` explanation: Unlimited only applies to when you are playing a beatmap.
  - When you are not playing a beatmap, the frame rate is limited to twice the refresh rate of your monitor, or 240fps, whichever is higher.
  - This option is **not recommended**. Using the `Unlimited (gameplay)` option can lead to stutters.
  - Using the `Optimal` option instead offers imperceivable changes in system (input to output) latency when compared to `Unlimited (gameplay)`.

### Debug

#### Build version

See which build version the game client currently has and which type of build updates the game client receives. Clicking on this will direct you to the release notes using your preferred browser.

The builds are versioned using this versioning scheme:

```
b{YYYY}{MM}{DD}.{revision}{type}
```

- `{YYYY}` is the build year
- `{MM}` is the build month
- `{DD}` is the build day
- `{revision}` is the build revision
  - If there is no build revision number, the decimal point will be removed.
- `{type}` is the build type
  - If there is no build type value, assume it is `Stable`.

## Trivia

- If you type in a username but leave the password textbox empty, osu! will use that name when saving the score locally.
- Opening the options sidebar will automatically trigger `osu! is up-to-date!`'s function (it will begin checking for updates).
- The `Seasonal backgrounds` option was added after positive feedback was given to the osu!dev team.
  - More details: [main menu background changes](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/606931)

### History

- The old options screen was an actual screen that had tabs, buttons, and a dark pale blue background.
- The old options screen also featured a skin selection screen that also allows you to preview live play of a beatmap in osu!.
  - After the options screen was moved over to a sidebar, this screen was still accessible by opening a skin file.
  - Access to this was later removed after skin previews and the live preview functions came to be.
