## Reset all Bindings

**Caution:** this button does **not** confirm you if you had really wanted to do so!

This button will reset all bindings to their defaults listed above.

## Trivia

**For mod select:**

- The mania xK mods are not listed there.
  - You can press keys `3` to `9` to enable the xK mods.
- Not all mod icons have a keyboard shortcut, such as:
  - 1K
  - 2K
  - Random
  - Co-op
  - Target Practice

### History

- The 1K and 2K mod icons once had a keyboard shortcut, `1` and `2` respectively.
  - These key bindings were removed because they conflicted with the keyboard navigation keys
    (pressing `1` would deselect the mod icons and `2` would exit the mods menu).
