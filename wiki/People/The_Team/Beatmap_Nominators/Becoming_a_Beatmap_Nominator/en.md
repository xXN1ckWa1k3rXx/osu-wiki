# Becoming a Beatmap Nominator

Users interested in joining the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators) need to go through an application process overseen by the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team) (NAT). 

Applications are conducted via the [NAT website](http://bn.mappersguild.com/bnapps).

Applicants are required to meet a modding activity requirement, submit at least two maps they have recently modded, and complete a [Beatmap Nominator Test](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Nominator_Test) on the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) in order to submit their application. A message from the NAT will be sent once a verdict has been decided. More information on applying can be found on the website.

## Basic criteria

Modders aiming to apply to the Beatmap Nominators must fulfill the following criteria:

- They have been modding beatmaps actively for at least 3 months prior to applying.
- They have accumulated at least 150 or 200 [kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu) in total, depending on the mode they will apply to.
- They provide 2 to 4 of their mods which they think qualify them to be a part of the Beatmap Nominators.

### What qualifies as a mod post

- Upon signing up, the website will automatically calculate your kudosu score from the last 3 months.
- A qualified mod post is a user's posts on a beatmap discussion, in which at least one suggestion/problem got awarded with an upvote, and has been created within the 3 months.
- The game mode that you modded beatmaps in does not matter as your activity in the modding community as a whole is being measured and not the activity in a certain game mode.
- The point in time at which the kudosu has been awarded to your mod post **does** matter, as the calculator embed in the website will fetch the data from your own Modding History events.

### Modding expectations

Submitted mods should show that a user is capable of analyzing and improving maps to a standard fit for the Beatmap Nominators.

The following are modding traits expected of Beatmap Nominators. Failure to display any of these traits may result in a rejected application.

- Coverage of all difficulty levels
- Identification of unrankable issues, including ones tools can't detect, such as incorrect timing or metadata
- Comparison between parts of a map to support issues or suggestions
- Commentary about a wide variety of map elements, such as rhythm, spacing, movement, intensity, contrast, and consistency
- Identification of both isolated issues and general map-wide issues

### How the required minimum score is calculated

- This depends on the total `ModScore` an applicant achieved over the last months. This value is determined according to the following formula:

![ModScore Formula](/wiki/shared/Modscore_new_wiki.png "ModScore Formula")

`m` = Minimum expected number of individual beatmaps modded in a month\
`M` = Total achieved number of individual beatmaps modded in a month

- [The website](http://bn.mappersguild.com/bnapps) has a tool for calculating `ModScore` on its main page.
- In order to determine their required minimum score, the sum of the total `ModScore` within the last three months must be greater or equal to zero,
- The overall minimum threshold is set to the following values:
  - osu!taiko, osu!catch and osu!mania: `m` = 3 and a total of 150 kudosu or more
  - osu!: `m` = 4 and a total of 200 kudosu or more
- It is usually a good idea to keep your score above these numbers, as they can vary slightly depending on the number of applicants.

### How new potential Beatmap Nominators are chosen

- The `ModScore` of all applications will be double-checked to confirm if they reached the required minimum score.
- Modders that acquired enough score will be evaluated by the corresponding NAT members of the game mode they applied for, taking into account the following criteria:
  - General attitude: Tone of delivery of the mods and other behavioural expectations from the [Code of Conduct](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/Code_of_Conduct), as well as general behaviour in chat/forums.
  - Modding abilities: Knowledge of the general [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) and specific criteria of each game mode. Additional abilities like Metadata, Timing, and some others will also be taken into consideration.
- After evaluating each modder, a discussion will be made on whether the modder will join the Beatmap Nominators.

## Cooldowns

Depending on your status, your cooldown and modscore requirement before you can apply again may vary.

### Failed applications

You have these requirements if you failed a Beatmap Nominator application and apply again.

| Type | Cooldown | Activity Requirements |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Standard | 90 days | `ModScore` greater than 0 over 90 days |
| Reduced | 60 days | `ModScore` greater than 0 over 90 days |
| Failed [Beatmap Nominator Test](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Nominator_Test) | 30 days | `ModScore` greater than 0 over 90 days |

### Rejoining after being removed from the Beatmap Nominators

Users who have recently left the Beatmap Nominators may have different requirements to rejoin compared to when they first joined. For users who have performed well prior to leaving, they may be able to rejoin with relaxed requirements. The NAT will inform the user if they have the opportunity to fast-track their way back into the Beatmap Nominators.

If you were a Beatmap Nominator before, these requirements apply unless you have failed an application since last time you were a Beatmap Nominator.

| Type | Cooldown | Activity Requirements |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Standard | 60 days | `ModScore` greater than 0 over 60 days |
| Activity | 30 days | `ModScore` irrelevant, but 8 mods in 60 days |
| Good | 30 days | `ModScore` greater than 0 over 30 days |
