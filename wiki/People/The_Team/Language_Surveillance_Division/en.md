# Language Surveillance Division

*For the modern team of moderators, see: [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team).*

**Language Surveillance Division** (colloquially known as the *LSD*) was a usergroup responsible for the moderation of language-specific communities inside osu!. Each of its members had a dedicated area of focus: a language channel where they were mainly present, and respective forum sections that they could manage (such as places like [Help](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/5) or [Off-Topic](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/52)). <!-- TicClick: no to-do, as it's hard enough to accomplish, but having the early history of the team and its roots, and a complete list of all chat moderators, would be appreciated -->

## Tasks

Members of LSD were hand-picked by the osu! team from the community to act as moderators for lower-traffic communities and subforums. Unlike Global Moderators, they did not have features like coloured nicknames, or custom forum titles. On [IRC](/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), however, they were [operators](/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat#why-are-some-usernames-prefixed-with-different-signs?) and could apply [silences](/wiki/Silence).

The LSD also served as an intermediary group for promising members pending admission into the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team) at times, as the two groups generally shared a common goal and similar skill sets.<!-- internal reference: https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/123465 -->

## Restructuring

<!-- TODO(TicClick): make this an infobox -->

After a [staff restructuring](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/123510) in 2013, the Language Surveillance Division was renamed as the **Chat Moderators** and received its own members listing<!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20140209160121/http://osu.ppy.sh:80/g/18 -->.

On [August 20, 2015](/wiki/Staff_Log/2015#august), the Chat Moderators and Global Moderation teams [were merged](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/4435972), effectively giving all moderators distinctive red nicknames in chat and management power over the whole forum.
