## Ruleset

### Tournament rules

1. The osu!mania 7K World Cup is a country-based team tournament, played on the osu!mania game mode with 7-key specific beatmaps.
   - While this competition is planned as a 3 versus 3 setup, this might change depending on the amount of incoming registrations.
2. **Map scoring is based on Score V2. It uses an alternative way of weighting hit objects, accuracy and combo.**
3. The beatmaps for each round will be announced by the mapset selector in advance on the Sunday before the actual matches take place. Only these will be used during the respective matches.
   - One map will be given as a tiebreaker map. This map will only be played in case of a tie.
4. Match schedule will be settled by the Tournament Management (see below).
5. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
6. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.
   - Reviving and surviving during a map gets considered as passing it.
7. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable map elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
8. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified.
9. If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map.
   - Disconnects within 30 seconds after map begin can be rematched. This is up to the referee's discretion. The played beatmap might be aborted for this.
10. Beatmaps cannot be reused in the same match unless the game was nullified.
11. If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes.
12. Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations.
13. Lag is not a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
14. All players are supposed to keep the match running fluent and without delays. Excessive match delays coming from the player's side can be issued with penalties.
15. If a player disconnects between the beatmaps and the team can not provide an exchange, the match can be delayed 10 minutes at maximum.

    - Declaring the match as Lost by Default
    - Disqualification from the entire tournament
    - Disqualification from the current and future official tournaments until appealed

   - Tournament Management declares one candidate to the captain of the country's team, albeit temporarily.
