5. If a player does not show up within **10 minutes** of the start time, their opponent wins by default.
6. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
7. **NoFail will be enforced in all beatmaps.** This is to ensure that the points are to be awarded more fairly towards players who perform better in general during the course of the beatmap regardless of their remaining health at the end.

   - Disconnects that occur within a few seconds after the beatmap is started by the referee can be rematched.
9. If a player disconnects between beatmaps, the match can be delayed up to 15 minutes at most.
   - In case the disconnected player failed to report back after the maximum allowance of 15 minutes had passed, the opposing player may be declared to be winning the match by default.
10. Lag is not a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
11. If there are any problems during the match occurence, the Tournament Management will make a decision based on referee's report.

   - This rule does not apply in the Qualifier lobbies.
2. Each player has to ban **one beatmap** (in the Round of 12 and the Quarterfinals) or **two beatmaps** (in the Semifinals onwards) from the corresponding mappool. These beatmaps will not be allowed to be picked by any player during the entire match.
   - Each player may not ban two beatmaps from the same mod pool, except from the NoMod pool. For example, banning NM1 and NM2 is allowed; banning NM1 and HD1 is allowed; banning HD1 and HD2, however, is *not* allowed.
   - Banning does not apply in the Qualifier lobbies.
