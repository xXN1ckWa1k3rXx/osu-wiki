## Ruleset

### Tournament rules

1. The Catch the Beat World Cup is a 3v3, team-based tournament played on the osu!catch game mode.
2. Beatmap scoring is based on **[ScoreV1](/wiki/Score#scorev1)**.
3. The beatmaps for each round will be announced by the tournament host on the discussion thread in advance before the actual matches take place. Only these beatmaps will be used during the respective matches. 
   - One beatmap will be a tiebreaker beatmap. This beatmap will only be played in case of a tie.
4. The match schedule will be settled by the Tournament Management (see the [scheduling instructions](#scheduling-instructions) for more information).
5. If no staff is available, the match will be postponed.
6. If a beatmap ends in a draw, it will be nullified.
7. If a player disconnects, their scores will not be counted towards their team's total.
8. Beatmaps cannot be reused in the same match unless said beatmap was nullified.
9. If a team fails to bring in the required minimum of three players to a match, the corresponding match can be declared as a forfeited match where the opposing team gets automatically awarded with a Win by Default.     
10. Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations.
    - **If a rematch is required, exchanging players is not allowed. With the Tournament Management's discretion, an exception can be made if the previous roster is unavailable to play.**
11. Lag is not a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
12. All players are expected to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Penalties can and will be issued to the players if they cause excessive match delays.
13. If a player disconnects between beatmaps and the team cannot provide a replacement, the match can be delayed by 10 minutes at most.
14. All players and the staff must be treated with respect. Instructions of the Tournament Management are to be followed. Decisions labeled as final are not to be objected.
15. Disrupting the match by foul play, insulting or provoking other players or the staff, delaying the match, or other deliberate and inappropriate misbehavior is strictly prohibited.
16. Unexpected incidents are to be handled by the Tournament Management.
17. Penalties for violating the tournament rules may include the following:
    - Exclusion of specific players for one beatmap
    - Exclusion of specific players for an entire match
    - Declaring the match as Lost by Default
    - Disqualification from the entire tournament
    - Disqualification from the current and future official tournaments until appealed
    - Any modification of these rules will be announced.

### Tournament registration

1. In order to be registered for the tournament, a representative of each team will have to propose a team roster comprising of three to four players in the discussion thread following a template set by the Tournament Management as follows:

```
Team Name: (...)
Region: (...)

Player 1 (Captain): (...)
Player 2: (...)
Player 3: (...)
Player 4: (...)

Time Zone: (...)
```

2. To ensure valid and serious registrations, all proposed team rosters will be checked by the Tournament Management.
3. All accepted teams will be announced in the discussion thread after the Registration Phase.
   - **A team should have at least three players registered in order to be eligible to participate.**
4. Once a team roster has been accepted, it remains locked for the rest of the tournament. No further changes may be made to it except on extraordinary circumstances under the Tournament Management's approval.

### Match instructions

1. A member of the Tournament Management will create a multiplayer room 15 minutes in advance. Players must gather during this period.
   - Room settings are osu!catch, Team-Vs., Win Condition: 'Score'. Room name must be "CWC: (TeamRed) vs (TeamBlue)".
   - The team mentioned first in the room name must be set as the red team and the team mentioned second in the room name must be set as the blue team.
2. As the Catch the Beat World Cup features no formal referee, **both team captains are expected to referee the match by themselves from inside the multiplayer lobby**. If there are any suspected irregularities during the run of the match, the concerned team captain may file a report in the discussion thread which will be investigated by the Tournament Management in due time.
3. Beatmap banning **does not apply** in the entirety of the tournament.
4. Each team must have three players for each beatmap. Players can be exchanged and substituted freely between beatmaps.
5. Beatmap selection will alternate between each captain selecting a beatmap out of the mappool.
6. Each captain must use the `!roll` command once in `#multiplayer`.
   - The captain with the higher roll decides which team **picks** first.
7. The results of each match will be posted on the discussion thread after the match has been concluded by either of the team captains.

### Stage instructions

1. In the Group Stage, the teams will be divided into four groups of five teams each.
2. All the teams from each group will face each other over the course of five weeks.
   - Due to the odd number of teams in each group, all teams **will only be playing on four matchweeks** instead of on all five by default. Team captains are expected to be aware of the schedules announced by the Tournament Management.
3. Depending on the outcome of a Group Stage match, each team will be alloted Group Stage points to their name as follows:
   - Winning a match gives the team +3 Group Stage points.
   - Losing a match gives the team +1 Group Stage point.
   - Forfeiting a match, either by disqualification or by a Lost by Default, penalizes the team by -3 Group Stage points.
4. Rankings of each group are determined by sorting the results of each team's performance in the following priority:
   - Most Group Stage points accumulated.
   - Most matches won.
   - Have higher `{(the number of beatmaps won) - (the number of beatmaps defeated)}`.
   - Most beatmaps won.
   - **Winner of the match played previously between the tied teams.**
   - In the event of a triple tie:
     - Have higher `∑{(total score difference) / (maximum score)}`.
     - Winner of the rematch.
5. The top two teams of each group will move on to the knock-out stages following the matchup bracket set by the Tournament Management.   
   - The knock-out stages are played under the Single Elimination system.

#### Winning conditions

- The Group Stage matches will be played in a Best-of-3 matchup configuration (first team to reach 2 points wins).
- The Quarterfinals matches will be played in a Best-of-5 matchup configuration (first team to reach 3 points wins).
- The Semifinals matches will be played in a Best-of-7 matchup configuration (first team to reach 4 points wins).
- The Finals matches will be played in a Best-of-9 matchup configuration (first team to reach 5 points wins).

### Mappool instructions

1. There will be a different mappool for every stage.
2. All beatmaps in the mappool (including the Tiebreaker) will be played without any modifications enabled (NoMod).
3. Each mappool has a specific size depending on the stage:
   - All Group Stage weeks will feature nine NoMod maps (to be picked in any order) plus one Tiebreaker map.
   - The Quarterfinals will feature four NoMod maps (**to be played in the order determined by the Tournament Management**) plus one Tiebreaker map.
   - The Semifinals will feature six NoMod maps (**to be played in the order determined by the Tournament Management**) plus one Tiebreaker map.
   - The Finals will feature eight NoMod maps (**to be played in the order determined by the Tournament Management**) plus one Tiebreaker map.   

### Scheduling instructions

1. Each stage will be held on its respective timeframe set by the Tournament Management.
2. Scheduling will be handled by the Tournament Management. Schedules will be released on the Sunday before the first matches of the stage.
3. **Reschedules will only be considered if both teams agree to a time. This needs to be done and communicated to the Tournament Management before the particular match takes place.**
4. **Reschedules may only be requested by a team captain.**
   - **Do not ask for a reschedule unless it is absolutely necessary. The Tournament Management has the right to decline the request.**
5. Captains are responsible for their teams' availability. The greater team size exists to ensure every team can provide at least three players for each match. If a team is unable to provide three players for a match, the match will be considered forfeited.
